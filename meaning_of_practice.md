# Patipatti: Direct Approach to Buddhist Reality

## Briefing: The Meaning of Practice (Patipatti) in Buddhism
This briefing summarises key concepts from the provided text, "Excerpts from 'The meaning of practice'", which delves into the Buddhist understanding of 'practice' (Pāli: *Patipatti*). The text emphasises a direct, experiential understanding of reality as opposed to mere theoretical knowledge.

## Main Themes & Key Ideas:

### 1. Patipatti: Direct Approach to Reality
*   The Pāli word for practice, **Patipatti**, is broken down as "Patti is particularly and pati is to attain or to approach".
*   This signifies a direct, experiential engagement with truth: "Forward to the reality."
*   It's not about intellectual comprehension of concepts like *citta* (consciousness) or *cetasikas* (mental factors), but rather directly "experienc[ing] the object".
*   The goal is to "get closer to understand the truth" by directly perceiving "that which is there."

### 2. Awareness of Singular, Fleeting Reality
*   *Patipatti* involves focusing on "particularly one object only" at a time, as "Otherwise, it cannot be known when they are together."
*   Reality, whether during sleep or waking, is constantly arising and passing away: "just that which is there, the reality which arises and experience the object, only in one moment and then gone. Condition the next moment to arise, experience its object and gone. All the time in life".
*   This immediate, momentary nature of reality is often overlooked, being "so close, but it's so far to understand. Because no idea, no thought, no teachings, no words about its truth."

### 3. Moving Beyond Conceptual Understanding to Direct Knowing
*   The text distinguishes between hearing/talking about truth and directly knowing it. "Should it be known directly, not just hearing and talking about it."
*   While understanding different characteristics of realities is part of the process, "To just to be aware is not enough, no one knows, what does it mean, what is it."
*   The Buddha's teachings provide guidance on "the truth of each moment," helping to build "firm confidence of the truth that its there right now."
*   True understanding (**Sacca-ñāṇa**) involves knowing that "The truth can never be changed; the ultimate truth of life of each moment."
*   However, this understanding must be **experiential**: "But it's not enough, just to know it by words because it's there now. Seeing is there now, it's not just the word. It has to be known, not just saying it sees but now it's so close, it sees now."
*   The Pāli word **sati** (mindfulness) is introduced as the reality through which this direct knowing occurs.

### 4. The Nature of Dukkha and Anattā
*   All phenomena are *dhammas*, arising and falling away due to conditions.
*   The concept of **Dukkha** (suffering/unsatisfactoriness) extends beyond just "painful feeling, unpleasant feeling." It encompasses the inherent impermanence and fleeting nature of all experiences: "no matter it's pleasant or unpleasant, right understanding or ignorance, all gone. Just there so very, very, very short. No one knows because it arises and falls away very quickly."
*   Ignorance leads to perceiving these fleeting phenomena as *atta* (self or something substantial). "All of them are taken as atta (something), so it's the world of atta."
*   Right understanding, through *patipatti*, reveals the truth of **anattā** (non-self/not-self): "But right understanding is not atta, it's anattā, its the world of anattā."
*   The development of this understanding (**Bhavana**) leads to directly perceiving reality as *anattā*, for instance, by experiencing "only hardness and that which is there experiences hardness, no, nothing is there at all. The world is gone, so it's clear understanding." This illustrates a moment of pure experience devoid of self-identification, revealing the impersonal nature of reality.
