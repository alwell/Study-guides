# Understanding the Truth of Not-Self

## Briefing Document: Review of Excerpts from "No 'I'"
**Date:** October 27, 2023
**Subject:** Review of excerpts from the text "No 'I'", exploring core Buddhist concepts of "not-self" (annatā), truth (sacca), and perfection (parami).
**Key Themes and Ideas:**
The provided excerpts delve deeply into the fundamental Buddhist concept of "**annatā**" or "**not-self**," emphasizing its central role in realizing the nature of reality. The text highlights the interconnectedness of **understanding (paññā)**, **truth (sacca)**, and **perfection (parami)** as the path to realizing this truth. The discussion repeatedly circles back to the **present moment** as the sole object of true understanding and the difficulty of moving beyond conceptual knowledge to a lived understanding of "**no 'I'**".

## Most Important Ideas/Facts:

*   **Annatā (Not-Self) as the Core Truth:** The foundational premise is that all realities, or "**dhammas**," are inherently "**annatā**" (not-self) and **unsatisfactory**. Realizing this truth is the ultimate goal of the path.
    *   > **Quote:** "So the truth is that there are just **dhammas**, realities that are **annatā** (not-self) and **unsatisfactory**, and the way to realise this is to develop the path, the development of understanding."
*   **The Present Moment is the Object of Understanding:** True understanding can only arise in relation to **what appears now**. Theoretical knowledge or future contemplation is insufficient.
    *   > **Quote:** "Yes, and all about what we are talking about, is **now**. So **pañña**, understands the truth of how much understanding of **this moment** of whatever **appears now**."
    *   > **Quote:** "Because as we hear again and again, we know that the only object of right understanding is **what appears now**. So this should mean, it's **this moment** that what should be understood is **this moment**."
*   **Sacca (Truth) and Sacca Parami (Perfection of Truth):** **Sacca** refers to the truth of reality as it is. **Sacca parami** is the **perfection of this truth**, which is inextricably linked to **understanding**. It's not about having the "right answer" conceptually, but a firm understanding of the reality.
    *   > **Quote:** "That is **sacca parami** (perfection of truth)."
    *   > **Quote:** "If there's no understanding of **this moment** is there **sacca**? Is that true, is that the truth? The **'I'** is there, **ignorance** is there."
    *   > **Quote:** "That is **sacca parami** when the answer is **sacca**, the truth of it."
    *   > **Quote:** "If one asks should we try and when the answer is no me, **no 'I'** the person who asks knows how much one understands. So Acharn should that you were saying earlier can be referenced to **firm understanding** that it's only **this moment** that can be the object of **understanding**."
*   **Understanding is Paññā (Wisdom):** **Paññā** is the **understanding** that facilitates the realization of "**not-self**." All "**paramis**" (**perfections**) are aspects of **paññā**.
    *   > **Quote:** "So **all paramis are paññā in all aspects**."
*   **The Difficulty of Truly Understanding "No 'I'":** Merely stating "**no 'I'**" or having the conceptual answer is not sufficient. True **understanding** requires a deep, **firm realization** that transcends intellectual knowledge. The presence of "**I**" and **ignorance** indicates a lack of this **understanding**.
    *   > **Quote:** "Acharn, even the word **sacca** is very hard to understand and we have our own ideas about what it is. And it's not like after we've heard there will be understanding, but it just takes time, as **understanding** develops like any other reality."
    *   > **Quote:** "Even the word **no 'I'** is it **sacca**? Acharn, if there's no **sacca**, then one would think that one understands **no 'I'** already but even when we say that there's no understanding, we're not sure if it is **sacca** there or it's just another something else."
    *   > **Quote:** "So just say no self is there any understanding? Probably not. **Firm enough**, see, so it's not **sacca** when it's not **understanding**..."
    *   > **Quote:** "Even the answer **no 'I'** is not enough, so **what is it**, see, to be **firm** that it's **no 'I'**? Not only the word **no 'I'** but **what is it** so it is **no 'I' not me**."
*   **The Nature of Reality Supports "No 'I'":** The **impermanent** nature of reality, where each moment arises and falls away, inherently demonstrates the absence of a lasting, controllable **self**.
    *   > **Quote:** "**What appears now** arises and falls away, is that true? Even it does not appear yet, but is it true? That is **sacca parami** when the answer is **sacca**, the truth of it."
    *   > **Quote:** "**Because it ends every moment**, so how can there be **'I'**?"
    *   > **Quote:** "There is **not me last life**, there cannot be **me next life** so **no 'I'** even right now **from moment to moment**."
*   **Trying to Understand is Problematic:** The very act of "**trying**" implies a "**self**" that is doing the trying. True **understanding** arises depending on conditions, not through forceful effort driven by the idea of an "**I**".
    *   > **Quote:** "**Should we try to understand**? When it's the right answer, it is **sacca parami**. Well it's **understanding** but the right answer, just getting the right answer doesn't necessarily mean **understanding** does it? See, no one, **no 'I'** , the answer is **no 'I'** even the question is **should we try**, **no 'I' is sacca parami**."
    *   > **Quote:** "One might be taught to **try very hard** to do or to understand. See, that cannot be **sacca**. It cannot be **sacca parami** because actually, **no 'I'**."

## Summary:
The excerpts from "No 'I'" present a rigorous exploration of the Buddhist concept of "**not-self**" (**annatā**). The text emphasizes that true **realization** of this truth comes through the development of **understanding** (**paññā**) in relation to the **present moment**. It distinguishes between intellectual knowledge of "**no 'I'**" and a **firm, lived understanding**, highlighting the difficulty in overcoming the ingrained sense of a **self**. The **impermanent** nature of reality is presented as evidence for the absence of a lasting "**I**", and the inherent problem with "**trying**" to understand from the perspective of a **self** is discussed. Ultimately, the text underscores that **sacca parami**, the **perfection of truth**, lies in the developing **understanding** of "**no 'I'**" as it manifests in the reality of each **fleeting moment**.
